Based on the <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/torque">original project</a> from <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">dylanaraps</a><br>
I decided to change the name (to not conflict with other existing programs) and add many more features

A simple TUI client for the `transmission-cli`.

- Written in `bash`.

## Dependencies

1. Start `transmission-daemon`.
2. Run `tormix`.

... More to come
